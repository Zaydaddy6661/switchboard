  <h1>How to use the Language Resource Switchboard</h1>
  <p>There are two versions of the Language Resources Switchboard (LRS): the standalone version,
  where users can drag and drop their own resources from the file system into the LRS drop area, and the VLO version,
  where users can call the LRS for selected resources from the Virtual Language Observatory. This
  document describes the standalone version, but it as well applicable for the VLO version once the
  LRS has been called with a <it>single</it> resource. </p>


  <h3>Usage:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Drag a file from your file manager to the dotted area in the screen. Alternatively, click
      on the dotted area, then select a file to be uploaded. <small>Note that the selected file will be
      uploaded to a temporary file storage onto a CLARIN-based server</small></li>
    <li>A file information pane appears with basic information about the file. Please verify
    whether the information that has been gathered in the pane is correct. Use the pull-down menus
    for 'mimetype' and 'language' to correct existing information, or to add missing
      information. Both language and mimetype must be supplied before the next step</li>
    <li>In the file info pane, click on 'Show Tools'. The 'Task Oriented View' should now show a
      list of applicable tools capable of processing the resource in question. The tools are
      ordered, given the task they perform.</li>
    <li>Click on a tool of interest to get additional information about the selected tool.</li>
    <li>Click on 'Click to start tool' to open the selected tool in a new browser tab.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>a reference to your resource as well as its mimetype and language is being passed onto the tool.</li>
      <li>some tools require a login/password. You may need to register with tool providers before you can use a given tool.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
